Here another project build by using every last brain cell that left after a HUGE reel session.
If you are bored enough and your luck is so rotten that this repo was sent to you , then i apologies for that.
If you want to play this master piece GOATY(Goat of The Year) game , 
for windows , got to build/windows/x64/runner/Release.
If you are so bored enough that you want to play it on your phone , go to build/app/outputs/flutter-apk
and if you want the the JUNK the i wirte to run this poor app , which you call code , just go to lib and you may find some the best junk in the world.
